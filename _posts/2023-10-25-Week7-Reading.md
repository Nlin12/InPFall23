### Understanding Comics

* Chapter 4 discussed comics' characteristics as a form that blends space and time and its implications; Chapter 6 talked about the relationship between text and pictures in comics and beyond, and the history of their development.
* Takeaway: I feel like the approach of showing and manipulating time in comics is making use of people's imagination to give a format characteristics that it does not originally have. This could also be adapted to other similar scenarios (like giving a sense of space on a fixed-sized screen, or conveying the feeling of lightness or heaviness on objects with fixed width).
* I'm the kind of person who rarely reads books because I really can't focus on huge chunks of texts without other types of input. For me, videos or seeing in real life is the more comfortable way for information input. However, I am aware that text has its advantage of being more abstract, thus less dependent on the creator's depiction and more reliant on your own imagination, while in video you are limited to only how the creator sees it. Therefore I wonder if comics might be a good middle ground for me.
* Question: I think that one of the factors that pushed pictures back from absolute realism was the invention of photography, since it made other efforts to achieve realism way less rewarding and attractive. Can generative AI tools in recent years play a similar role to a more widespread acceptance of the reblending of pictures and texts?
