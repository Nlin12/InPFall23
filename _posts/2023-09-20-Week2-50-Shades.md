### Object I Chose

I always have an interest in railways/mass transits, as well as their signages.

Therefore the idea of playing around with subway signs immmediately occured when I read about this assignment. They are everywhere, they have a simple yet effective design, and they have a ton a variations, a good starting point.



### The Process

The starting point. This is the type of signage usually hanged on the beams near the platform edge. It's extremely simple, with white Helvetica text on black background.
