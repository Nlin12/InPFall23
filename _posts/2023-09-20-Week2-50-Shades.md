### Object I Chose

I always have an interest in railways/mass transits, as well as their signages.

Therefore the idea of playing around with subway signs immmediately occured when I read about this assignment. They are everywhere, they have a simple yet effective design, and they have a ton a variations, a good starting point.



### The Process

The starting point. This is the type of signage usually hanged on the beams near the platform edge. It's extremely simple, with white Helvetica text on black background.



#### Basic Changes

First I decided to do some basic UI/UX to warm up. I tried to improve the current design (well maybe not the "J" St one, that's just for fun) by adding some informations that I feel might be useful.

#### "The Future"

Then I reflected about the purpose of these signs. In the current digital age, nearly everyone has a smartphone with GPS, and trains with electronic displays, the importance of these signages seem to be declining. Here I used some humor to imagine a dystopian future where the signs serves simply as a portal to your glass screen.

#### Urban Development & Changes

Many NYC subway stations uses a "Primary name" that's usually based on the street it's located, followed by a "Secondary name" as a disambiguation or to mark a significant landmark nearby. However, street names are not necessarily the most intuitive way to refer to a area. If in the future an entity have grown to have a dominant significane of a place, will it be more straightforward to refer the place by that entity (sort of like how we call all tapes "Scotch")?

#### Around the World

I love how different cultures around the world adopt different designs to their signage system, and how social environments plays a role in shaping those design decisions. Here I recreated the station name sign in London Underground, Paris Metro, Hong Kong MTR, and Japan Railway style.
