### Object I Chose

I always have an interest in railways/mass transits, as well as their signages.

Therefore the idea of playing around with subway signs immmediately occured when I read about this assignment. They are everywhere, they have a simple yet effective design, and they have a ton a variations, a good starting point.



### The Process

The starting point. This is the type of signage usually hanged on the beams near the platform edge. It's extremely simple, with white Helvetica text on black background.



#### Basic Changes

First I decided to do some basic UI/UX to warm up. I tried to improve the current design (well maybe not the "J" St one, that's just for fun) by adding some informations that I feel might be useful.

#### "The Future"

Then I reflected about the purpose of these signs. In the current digital age, nearly everyone has a smartphone with GPS, and trains with electronic displays, the importance of these signages seem to be declining. Here I used some humor to imagine a dystopian future where the signs serves simply as a portal to your glass screen.
