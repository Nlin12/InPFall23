### Recap

[Last week](https://nlin12.github.io/InPFall23/2023-10-15-Week6-Time-Capsule-II/), I designed the form of my time capsule consisting of things related to railway and travel. Instead of it being buried in the ground, I took advantage of people's tendency to overlook ordinary things in life and imagined the time capsule being casually placed on an unnoticed corner of a railway station.

### Ideation & Storyboarding

Probably compared to other imaginations of what the world might be 125 years into the future--Mars, underwater, nuclear winter, etc., my vision is more or less mundane. Something's better, something's worse, but humans are still largely living under the same world order we know.

However, it's reasonable to expect the ways of transport will dramatically change. Just like 2023 compared to 1900, including railways. Even today, railways around the world are facing challenges from population decrease, planes, and the prevalence of private cars. I want my story to both remind people of the glamour of railway travel and the railway's importance to us, and convey the message that at the end of the day, it's us human who makes the journey meaningful and memorable, and we should never lose our will and curiosity to travel and explore.

I decided to make it a still-image-based short video, since it will be a good blend of vividness and ease of production. Then I began some basic storyboarding, sketching out a story of two people witnessing an old train station being demolished, and got to see the items in the time capsule.

### Creation Process

In terms of the graphics, even though I would like to try out drawing, I'm aware that with my skill, there's virtually no way I can finish it in reasonable time and quality. Therefore, I took a somewhat middle ground: using simple line sketches as image prompts for AI image generator, which is also what I'm exploring on in Augmented Storytelling class this semester.

As it turned out (pretty much expected actually), it's not smooth sailing to get the image that you desired from AI image generators. Therefore I did a lot more trial and tweaking, in the end combining text prompts, sketch prompts, and real-life photo prompts to achieve somewhat satisfying results.

Then, since I was not planning to dub the texts, I needed to have some background music for the video. I used Garageband to make a very simple version of a classic folk song "I've been working on the railroad". It has been translated to a Japanese version, 線路は続くよどこまでも, which is used in various railway-culture-related occasions.

Initially, I created a version that imitates the jingles that play in train stations through PA systems. Although I liked how it sounded, it was too loud for background music for the main story. In the end, I made a mellower version, and placed the original one after the end of the story, where I showed some photos I took like a credit roll.

### Conclusion & Reflects

The creation of this video (and the Time Capsule project as a whole) is a challenge because storytelling is not something I'm familiar with or good at. The more subjective, personal approach to the messages and creative decisions is quite new to me. What's more, the 3-part process of this assignment involved such a wide range of expressive mediums, so I feel like it was a good opportunity for me to try new things and get a feel of the strengths and differences between various mediums.
