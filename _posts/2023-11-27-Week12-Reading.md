### Personas â€“ A Simple Introduction

* The article introduces how personas are used during the design thinking process, including different types of personas and their application, and typical components of a persona description.
* Takeaway: For engaging personas, the primary goal of their construction and descriptions is to bring the character to life, therefore making it easier for designers to engage and think for the target users.
* I think using fictional personas in the early stage of design can be a good practice to explore. They could be used to explore the potential target user groups of a design idea that is probably not realized by the designers. 
* Question: What is a good balance point of the generalization of user characteristics and needs when developing personas?

### Methods to Help You Define Synthesise and Make Sense in Your Research

* This article discussed how to go from research results to developing key insights and problem statements.
* Takeaway: The methodologies of incorporating personas into Who-What-Why user stories and broader scenarios, defining the POV through extracting the most important human needs, as well as framing the POV with "How might we" questions, are helpful to keep in mind during analysis and problem statement stages.
* I find the "Saturate and Group" method to be not only useful for analyzing results, but also an efficient way to document observations since it does not limit you to a certain format when documenting your findings and thoughts, which is especially valuable in situations where the thing you're observing happens at a high pace (like pedestrians).
* Question: During the mapping process, is it better to process the data while the research process is still ongoing so that you can be responsive to your research method, or is it better to wait for all the participants to be researched, so that you have more data to draw the points?
