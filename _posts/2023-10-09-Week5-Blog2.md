### The Story

I traveled to Takayama from Osaka through a 4-hour train trip.

Takayama is probably one of the most successful examples of a Japanese city that took advantage of its rich tradition and developed a strong tourism sector. Its well-preserved Edo-period architecture, traditional folk arts, tasty Wagyu beef, and world-famous Sake made it a perfect location for tourists looking for a shake-up from the bustling city life of Tokyo.

However, just having tourist attractions is not enough to make Takayama a city that welcomes more than 6 times its population of foreigners each year. During my time at Takayama, I felt the city is better prepared for international visitors than even some of the much larger cities, from the detailed-carefully crafted multilanguage signs and information, to tourist buses that take you anywhere for less than $1, all the way to the newly rebuilt Takayama station: the welcome entrance when visitors first set foot in the city, which blends Edo style cypress merchant's house with contemporary glass facade.

Despite being called an "isolated island" sitting in the heart of Japan, connected to Nagoya through nearly 3-hours of train ride, this is a place that is trying its best to preserve its traditional culture, while at the same time overcoming disadvantages to establish itself as a city of world heritage known around the world.
