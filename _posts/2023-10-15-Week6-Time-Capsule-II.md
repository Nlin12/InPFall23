### Recap

Last week, I chose 3 categories of items to put in my time capsule: tickets, IC cards, and souvenirs. They are all related to my interest in travel, railway, as well as the history and culture around human settlements. Now, it's time to design the physical form and presentation of the time capsule.

### Ideation & Sketching

The ideation process of the form of my time capsule can be described as two aspects of considerations emerging and meeting each other.

##### Aspect 1: Inviting contribution

As mentioned before in Part I, I want my time capsule to be "less personal"--Sure, these items still definitely reflect my personal passion for trains, but I also want them to have a "bigger picture". I want to make people think about our relationship with transportation and cities, and learn from the history to build better forms of transportation for the future.

To accomplish that, I believe it would require more than my own input in this time capsule. Ultimately, no matter how much I travel and how many places I have been to, they are only my own observations, at a certain time and year, under a certain context, and are dependent on my views and ideologies. By assembling similar experiences from different people, we can create a more comprehensive record of history. Driven by this incentive, I began searching for suitable formats that can serve as a time capsule but still allow for continued input.

##### Aspect 2: Related to railway

It's natural to have a form that is related to the theme of the contents, that is, railway. Therefore I began searching for existing things related to trains and railways that already carry the affordance of holding things and/or information as an inspiration. And turns out, there's a lot.

The first thing that comes to my mind is "station notes". This is especially a thing in Japanese small, unmanned stations. The original idea is that since the station has no staff and a small number of passengers, providing a notebook for passengers to write on is a cheap yet effective way to collect feedback. However, it has since evolved into a beloved symbol of such small stations. People use it to document all kinds of random thoughts, sharing why they embarked on the journey and arrived here, and what they saw at the station, some went as far as drawing professional illustrations on different station notes as a challenge. When you read through the note, it's like going back in time and having a conversation with people you never meet. I think this really allows you to see the same place through completely different perspectives, thus enriching your understanding of that place.

The second is the ticket boxes. They are also used to collect used tickets at unmanned stations, as well as those stations without automatic fare collection gates. There's not much to say about the box itself, essentially it's just a box with a slot that holds tickets. The reason why it interested me is that I found its usage is very similar to creating my time capsule--both putting tickets inside a container. Therefore, I started thinking of ways to take advantage of this similarity in designing the form of my time capsule. What's more, similar to the station notes, the contents inside the box are also not just about a single person, they are representations of hundreds of people's journeys, originating from different places, having different purposes, but in the end all converged to arriving at this station. This characteristic echoes my goal of inviting diversified input and cooperation.

Finally, there are the tickets and IC cards themselves, they carry hidden pieces of information on them too! Paper tickets have magnetic strips that are machine-readable, and IC cards use the FeliCa system based on RFID for holding trip information. This gave me the idea to blend the physical and the digital and enrich the information stored in my time capsule. Basically, items can be attached with digital IDs like RFID tags to link digital information and documentation to them.

### About Forgetting, and Rediscovering Something

Generally, when talking about time capsules, we expect them to be buried in the ground, and be unearthed after random or a certain amount of time. This is to ensure that present-day people "forget" about the time capsule so the items can be preserved without interference.

However, I can't help but notice that many times, it takes way less effort than that for us to completely ignore the existence of things. I'm sure that there's more than one item in my apartment right now that, since moving in, I have never touched and have forgotten that I even brought them here. Whenever I'm cleaning my room, I almost feel like discovering many small "time capsules".

Another more related example comes back to my trip and trains. I went to Japan to see the retirement of the KiHa 85 train. During the final couple of days, there were tons of people gathering at stations to take photos, and tickets for the train were sold out way ahead. Everyone was taking the chance to remember the iconic train. However, that got me thinking: This train had been running like this every day for more than 30 years. And as far as I know, the seats were seldomly full. So essentially, the trains were always there, but we just "forgot" about it until it was going away.

There's a term called "Bathtub Curve" in reliability engineering. The curve depicts the likelihood of failure during different stages of most products--high "infant mortality" at the start, high "wear out failures" near the end, and stable, low chances of failure during the rest of its product life. However, I think this graph is also a good fit to describe how much attention we pay to the things around us, whether it's personal or public. When a new thing appears it gets all the spotlight, but people soon get used to it and act like it's been there for eternity. Then when it's coming to an end, we suddenly are reminded of all the experiences and memories again.

*The Bathtub Curve*

Therefore, I decided that my time capsule should not be buried at all. Instead, it can simply be placed in an unassuming place in a public place. For most people, they will not give it a second look. And for those who care to contribute to the time capsule, it will also be easy for them to do that. When the place it resides is being demolished or fundamentally changed, the time capsule will have to be dealt with, and that's when I consider it to be "unearthed".

### Final Design

Therefore, the final design is comprised of 2 parts: a generic box for items to be dropped in, and tools for adding remarks or additional information (This can come in multiple mediums, like RFID or traditional written notes). They will be placed at the railway station counter or at the entrance. I hope that through this design, I can encourage people to contribute to building a collection of history with small things that they may deem as ordinary at the time.

I expect that as long as the station remains what it is, not many people will care enough about the capsule, let alone think about opening it. But after a couple of decades, the station will most likely need to be renovated, or abandoned and demolished, or repurposed for newer forms of transportation. When people of the future are cleaning out the stuff, they will then be reminded of this capsule's existence. That will also be a good time to open the capsule, since people are once again standing at the crossroads of change, it will be worth it to review where we're from.

### Prototyping

I think there really aren't many technical practices or workloads involved in this prototyping process.

The box really can be any box. In fact, the more unassuming it looks, the better it will blend in. Just like the ticket boxes used in railway stations, they do not even have a standard, mostly it's just the station staff making use of whatever they have at hand. For my prototype, I used an empty tissue box, since it already has the cutout at the top, which is super convenient. I flipped it inside out to hide the vibrant packaging, giving it a generic, natural look.

Then, I added a notebook and a pen as a more traditional method of documentation, as well as reused the cardboard RFID tag prototypes from the Redesigning Affordances assignment, to allow attaching digital media to the items put in the time capsule.

I also made some (bad) sketches imagining how they would look like when put in the actual environment.

### Conclusion & Reflects

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my process of designing the time capsule. Instead of designing an intriguing appearance, I reconsidered the purpose of time capsules, and how our attention (or lack thereof) to things around us changes with time. I really liked the idea of station notes because they allow you to share your story while learning about others' stories at the same time, and I'm glad that I can bring this kind of collaborative format into my time capsule design.
