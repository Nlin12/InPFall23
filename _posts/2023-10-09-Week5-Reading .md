### Evocative Objects

##### The Melbourne Train

* The train that passes through the small town serves as a symbol that represents the wider, industrialized outside world, and as a brief sneak peek of the people's life "at the end of the line". Moreover, the author's childhood experience on the train also shapes how he learns from the world.
* Takeaway: The author used trains as a metaphor when he was learning to write as a schoolboy, which is probably the thing that he is very familiar with. This inspires me to use things that I know and are unique to me as a way to learn and draw inspiration. 
*  The action of reading advertisements and station names out of the train window is so relatable. I think it's also one of my favorite childhood activities while I was traveling on the train.

##### Murray: The Stuffed Bunny

* Here, the stuffed bunny of the author's sister is not just a direct observation source of her research. Through the ways Shayna interacts with the bunny, she saw how those interactions reflect Shayna's own experimentation with new skills or her current feelings and needs. Eventually, this also prompts the author herself to project imagination and fantasies on the bunny and learn more about her inner self.
* Takeaway: Imagination and fantasy create a safe space for humans to practice new skills or express their own emotions.
* I think it's not uncommon to see adults act along with their kids in their fantasy plays. I used to think this is just them trying to entertain the kids, but now I feel that this might also be an enjoyment and a process of self-discovery.
* Question: Many adults will say that they have "grown out of" things like stuffed animals. Is this more a result of them finding a better way to practice skills and experiment with feelings, or is it more about conforming to social pressures?

### My Life with Things

* The author reflects on her life of consuming and interacting with things, and how the way that she sees them differentiates from people from different cultures and/or different ages. She realizes that we have to learn and unlearn about commodities, and learn to treat sold-to-us things.

* Takeaway: We express who and what we are through the things in our lives, just as language is to thoughts. By choosing what to consume and to keep in our lives based on our value of things, we are also making those values visible through things.

* I can relate to how the author felt a bit relieved that she lost Banky. Sometimes I would rather an outside factor, a force majeure makes the difficult choice or decision for me, so that I can tell myself "Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so no need to feel bad/regret".

* Question: What does it mean, or what's an example of "Unlearning what commodities are"?

### Storytelling & Narrative

* Very theoretical lecture on narrative and storytelling, a bit hard to grasp since it's a relatively new area for me. Would definitely look more into this topic. However, I do notice that many philosophers all mentioned creative expression (storytelling) is a form of conveying real-life messages through an imaginary worldview, whether for the reason of ease of conveying, bringing in new perspectives, or the persuasive power of evoking specific emotions among the audiences.

### Designing Your Own Card Deck

* What I see in the use cases of card decks are mainly their usage of cards' affordance of shuffling, creating unexpected, out-of-the-box ways of approaching a topic or a problem. This is kind of like switching to a new unconventional metaphor to an intangible topic to gain new perspectives. I think it can be useful when you can put some questions that you want answers to on one side, and put the skills/abilities/approaches that you have access to on the other side. And by shuffling the card deck you can create new solutions that you can work on.

### Douglas Atkins' Talk

* Super interesting talk. Claiming that cults are intrinsically normal and similar to any other community seemed controversial at first but makes great sense. And the idea of creating the sense of "us versus them" for your brand is very insightful. However, I think whether to apply this technique, and how much to take advantage of it in real-life settings is a super delicate and hard-to-balance practice, especially in today's society where it seems the last thing we need is more polarization.
