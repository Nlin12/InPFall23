### Introduction

In Phase I of UX Design Research we are required to discover around and explore themes related to a social phenomenon, focusing on assessing the problem without worrying about solutions or feasibility.

### Process

When selecting a social phenomenon to start, I initially naturally chose the NYC subway, it just seemed like such an easy target. However, when trying to develop further, I sort of got "stuck".

It's not like I can't come up with problems of the NYC subway. Instead, I feel like that it's such a complex system with complex problems, and as a person who only lived here for less than 3 months, I feel like my current understanding of the problems and phenomenons are still more from "hearsay" and "first impressions" than heartfelt feelings and deep understandings. As a result, it just feels like rehashing what others have been saying.

Therefore, I decided to branch out, finding topics related to the subway. I reviewed my frequent interactions with the city's public spaces, and out of those, jaywalking got my interest, because until I wrote it down I did not even realize that this was a "problem". Crossing the street when there's a signal that says "stop" is definitely not "normal", but people (including me) just adjusted and adopted it. However, this doesn't change its counter-intuitive and potentially dangerous nature.

I feel like this is a topic that I have more "personal stories" and observations, therefore I was able to churn out related points and ideas much more quickly.

When it comes to documenting the ideas, I tried something new: writing on Post-it notes and sticking them on the wall. There's no particular reason for it, I just felt like getting away from the desk and making the process more fun. I do feel like this format made me care less about the presentation and more about the contents. When I got a rough structure, I moved it to the digital world and finished my mess map there.

### Mess Map

I did some basic research on laws, news reports, and discussions regarding this topic alongside developing the mess map, which gave me a better understanding of the regulations, current developments, and public opinions about jaywalking. In the end, I categorized and color-coded my mess map into 5 categories, including current problems, system elements, stakeholders, factors of consideration and possible solutions.

### Conclusion & Reflects

After this session, I feel like jaywalking is an often-ignored, but very impactful and interesting topic to discuss and explore. It can involve considerations from multiple fields like interaction design, road safety, urban planning, and psychology. If I decide to explore this further in the coming weeks, I think I will conduct more extensive literature research into topics like pedestrian road safety and the cultural differences between societies.
