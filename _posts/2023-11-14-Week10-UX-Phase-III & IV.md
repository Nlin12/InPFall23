### Recap

Last week, by narrowing down the scope of the topic and literature research, I developed an initial version of my research question, and mapped out the stakeholders.

**Research Question:** How to reduce the efforts of newcomers and visitors to navigate NYC's road crossings safely and efficiently?

### Introduction

This week we are going to carry out Part III & IV of the project, conducting research on stakeholders, evaluating the results, and developing prototypes for initial concepts.

### Research

#### Stage 1: Fly on the Wall Observation

Since I'm going to focus on pedestrian crossing the streets, an event that's literally happening every time and everywhere, I thought it would be very intuitive to simply go out and observe, in detail and with purpose, how people are doing now.

Based on the previous literature research, I listed some questions that I hoped to find answers during the observation:

* What are the general behaviors of pedestrians crossing the street?

* How does the behavior of tourists differ from non-tourists?

* How does the behavior of the crowd differ when there are more tourists versus when there are mainly locals?

* What dangerous situations do pedestrians encounter when crossing? Which they are aware of and which they are unaware of?

* What measures do pedestrians take that ensure/undermine their safety?

* The difference in pedestrian behavior when there's a small/large crowd? The difference when are few people crossing on red vs many crossing on red?

From the reading [Hanington & Martin, Universal Methods of Design](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3399583), it is suggested that this type of observation be carried out in a semistructured way. Therefore, I only used these questions as a guide for my focus during the observation, not forcing myself to answer all of them completely. However, I did make a classification of the road environments, in order to facilitate choosing locations and provide comparisons.

On one axis, I have stop sign controlled intersections versus traffic light controlled minor intersections, representing different types of road types (I decided to roads excluding major roads like highways and boulevards, since when crossing these major streets people generally follow the signal).

On the other axis, I separated by the demographics of the pedestrians: whether the intersection sees more locals or tourists (the reason I did not include the "newcomers" group is because they are much harder to find and identify just by looking), through this classification I hoped to find the difference in behavior between the two groups, and how they influence each other.

I picked 4 places that represent the 4 types respectively and carried out the observation on Sunday, November 12. For each location, I observed for about 15 minutes. Initially I did plan to stay longer, but it became too cold to stand outside, and thanks to the higher-than-expected pedestrian traffic, I was still able to observe at least about 100 individuals during the period, ensuring the comprehensiveness of the observation. I relied solely on my phone for documenting, since I found it to be the least eye-catching in public, and the most convenient to quickly switch between typing text and taking pictures. I tried to follow the AEIOU structure in documenting the observation, but struggled to keep up with the pace of pedestrians. What; 's more, some aspects do not apply to the situation I'm researching well. Therefore, I decided to simply jot down whatever I saw and categorize them later.

*An example of the on-site documentation, including the basic information and observations of the location*

##### 1. (Stop sign-Local) Liberty St & William St

The first intersection is at Liberty St & William St in Downtown Manhattan. This is a classic stop-sign-controlled minor road intersection. Although surrounded by tourist attractions, this intersection mainly sees foot traffic from nearby business and residential properties.

Observation time: 14:08-14:23

Vehicle traffic: Moderate

Pedestrian traffic: Moderate

Road environment: One-way streets, 2 side parking 

Speed limit: Normal

![LibertyWilliam]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Liberty/01.jpg' | relative_url }})

![LibertyWilliam]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Liberty/02.jpg' | relative_url }})

One thing I quickly noticed is due to the building on the street corner and the parking on both sides of the street, pedestrians have to move into the road and lean forward to see if there's traffic coming.

![LibertyWilliam]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Liberty/03.jpg' | relative_url }})

This intersection also sees a lot of bicycles traveling. What's more, since one side of the street is coming down from a slope, they are traveling at a great speed and some do not stop at the sign.

![LibertyWilliam]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Liberty/04.jpg' | relative_url }})

Because this is a local-majority crossing, many pedestrains are looking at their ohones or listening to music or chatting with others, not paying much attention to the road environment. When approaching the intersection, some stopped briefly to check but some just walked straight in.

Other points observed:

* Some cars not coming to a complete stop at the stop sign
* A few locals looked both sides while crossing
* Kids stopping in the middle of the streets
* Some crossing the street diagonally
* A car was most likely speeding and almost failed to stop in time when a pedestrian crossed.

##### 2. (Stop sign-Tourist) Nassau St & Pine St

The second location is also in Downtown Manhattan, just outside the New York Stock Exchange. Originally I planned to observe at another intersection, but unfortunately it's closed due to roadwork. Because it's really hard to find a stop-sign-controlled crossing that also has high pedestrian traffic, I had to settle with this T intersection. 

Observation time: 14:26-14:41

Vehicle traffic: Low

Pedestrian traffic: Moderate

Road environment: One-way street, 1 side parking/one-way street with construction

Speed limit: Normal

![NassauPine]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Nassau/01.jpg' | relative_url }})

This intersection also has narrow streets with buildings close to the streets. This also leads to an extremely blocked view. The below photo shows a car that is completely blocked by the column, which I did not see at all until I was walking into the streets.

![NassauPine]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Nassau/02.jpg' | relative_url }})

![NassauPine]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Nassau/03.jpg' | relative_url }})

What's more, due to the extensive roadworks happening there, the road surface is in a pretty bad condition, and some zebra crossing markings are not visible anymore.

![NassauPine]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Nassau/04.jpg' | relative_url }})

Additionally, because the crossing is next to the pedestrian-only zone of Wall Street, many pedestrians seemed to continue walking in the middle of the road, leading to safety concerns.

![NassauPine]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Nassau/05.jpg' | relative_url }})

Other observations worth noting:

* Some pedestrians not crossing inside the zebra lines, and some even walk before the car stop line.
* Pedestrians crossing diagonally
* Tourists standing in the middle of the street to take pictures
* Tourists looking around, focus not on the street
* A few people looked both sides before crossing
* Some parents were holding kids' hands
* Some cars not stopping completely

##### 3. (Traffic Light-Tourist) W 45th St & 7 Av

The third location is right at the heart of Times Square, it's hard to find any other crossings thatg has this level of foot traffic and proportion of tourists.

Observation time: 15:24-15:39

Vehicle traffic: High

Pedestrian traffic: Extremely high

Road environment: One-way street, 2 sides parking/one-way multiple line major road

Speed limit: Normal

![W457Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W45/01.jpg' | relative_url }})

Although the crossing is always packed with pedestrians, the also-high vehicle traffic means that most of the time there's not much chance for crossing when the signal is red. Mostly, pedestrians can only take advantage of the time right before and after the signal changes.

![W457Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W45/02.jpg' | relative_url }})

Due to the traffic jam, many times there are cars that are still stuck in the intersection when the signal changes, which means pedestrians have to navigate between the cars, which creates a significant risk.

![W457Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W45/03.jpg' | relative_url }})

![W457Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W45/04.jpg' | relative_url }})

The busy sidewalks also pose a challenge for both the drivers and pedestrians, making it harder to identify oncoming threats.

![W457Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W45/05.jpg' | relative_url }})

To make matters worse, I have seen many drivers (particularly taxi and bus drivers) driving dangerously, overspeeding near the busy intersection. One taxi even tried to overtake on the narrow streets, narrowly stopping before the crowd.

![W457Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W45/06.jpg' | relative_url }})

One interesting observation is that when the cars stopped but the pedestrian signal has yet to turn white, if multiple people start to cross, the crowd will follow suit (which is the case most of the time). However, one time there was only one person that started crossing early, and no one in the crowd followed. This suggests that pedestrians will consider the social context and follow the actions of others (probably more so for tourists).

Other observations:

* Some cars turning right are not waiting for pedestrians to cross properly, instead are inching dangerously close to the pedestrians to cut through the crowd.
* People are more likely to cross the smaller streets on red than the wider one
* Some tourists are confused and not sure to follow or not when they see someone running the red light.
* A biker was purposefully driving dangerously and doing a wheelie on the road

##### 4. (Traffic Light-Local) W 74th St & 9 Av (Columbus Av)

The final location is in the mostly residential Upper West Side, and has the typical grid layout seen in midtown and uptown Manhattan.

Observation time: 15:55-16:10

Vehicle traffic: Medium-high

Pedestrian traffic: Medium-high

Road environment: One-way street, 2 sides parking/one-way multiple line major road, with parking on one side, bike lane on the other side

Speed limit: Normal

![W749Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W74/01.jpg' | relative_url }})

Like the previous location, the width and traffic on 9 Av also make it harder to cross at red light. However, many pedestrians are utilizing the refuge island to cross the bike lane on red. But that does not mean it's completely safe. I observed cyclists are also traveling at high speeds and in both directions.

![W749Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W74/02.jpg' | relative_url }})

![W749Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W74/03.jpg' | relative_url }})

I find that at this location, both the pedestrians and drivers act significantly bolder. Pedestrians would walk into the street even when there are cars in sight, and cars would also get very close to the pedestrians crossing. This is probably due to the locals being very familiar with the road environment and having a general expectation of how others may react.

![W749Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W74/04.jpg' | relative_url }})

![W749Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W74/05.jpg' | relative_url }})

However, the social factor still plays a role in their behavior. When there's a bigger crowd, people generally are less hesitant to cross.

![W749Av]({{ '/assets/img/W10/W74/06.jpg' | relative_url }})

Other observations:

* The view is less restricted. However, parked cars still makes it difficult to see upcoming cars
* Many people looking at their phones when crossing

#### Stage 2: Contextual Inquiry

Based on the observation result from the Fly-on-the-Wall observation, I used contextual inquiry to observe an individual closely, and clarify and confirm some of the assumptions directly with the participant. However, due to the limited time I had remaining at this time, I only met with 1 person. Nevertheless, the process provided some valuable personal insights.

The participant I contacted is a PhD candidate at Columbia University. He came to NYC in August 2023, therefore matches my target group of newcomers in the city. The inquiry took place on public roads around Columbia University, and was conducted through multiple sessions over 5-7 p.m., during which the participant was running his ordinary errands.

![Columbia]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Columbia/01.jpg' | relative_url }})

![Columbia]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Columbia/02.jpg' | relative_url }})

*One part of the walk*

Although the topic was largely kept open, I did prepare some questions based on my observations, and brought them up accordingly if a similar situation or action appears during the process. Some of the questions include:

* What are the problems & confusions you faced when crossing the streets in NYC?
* How do you find the locals and newcomers/tourists behave differently?
* What safety measures do you take when crossing the street?
* How do you find the cultural factor plays a role in the road crossing behavior?

The key findings and observations during the inquiry are as follows:

##### Behavior:

* The participant crossed a 4 lane, 2 way street when the signal was just turning red. When asked why he would consider it safe to do so, he responded that his familiarity of the street and surroundings, as well as the traffic condition are both factors to his decision.
* On most minor streets, the pedestrian cross the street as soon as confiming the road is clear, regardless of the signal, along with other pedestrians. The participant confirmed that most pedestrains here does not cross according to the signals.
* The participant will look both sides before crossing, even on one-way streets. The participant confirmed that this is a measure he often takes to ensure safety. When asked for reason, he pointed out that apart from safety concerns, his habit can also be attributed to his previous experience fo living in Beijing, where there's a significant larger proportion of two-way streets.
* When the participant arrived at a crossing with few people, he subconsciously stopped for a brief second before proceeding to cross.

##### Thoughts & Feelings:

* When the participant first arrived in NYC, he found it surprising that pedestrians here were not following the signals. But he soon adopted and followed what others were doing. He said that since everyone was doing that, he did not find it to be too much of a problem. What's more, on smaller streets, it only takes a short amount of time to cross, therefore it's easy to ensure safety.
* Cultural factors: The participant does not see himself as a person who will stick to the rules no matter the circumstances. Therefore, although he would not run the red light actively, he would follow others if it's considered safe and culturally acceptable.
* A similar situation as in the observation appeared during the inquiry, where the crowd did not follow when only a single person crossed the street but others did not follow. When asked about the situation, the participant also described the phenomenon similarly to what I have observed, that only a larger crowd would be effective in motivating others to cross when the road environment is not completely clear.

### Concepts & Prototypes

Based on the analysis of research results, I started to think about possible solutions for some of the leading problems.

#### 1. The car-sensing signal

One of the consistent observations (also my own experience) is the view of pedestrians of the road is often blocked by parking cars or other obstacles. This could put the pedestrian in danger whether on a stop-sign-controlled street or when they are crossing on red lights.

This reminds me of a specific type of railway crossing signal: the type that shows which side is the train coming from. This provides added safety when the barrier breaks or someone gets trapped inside the crossing. A similar mechanic can be employed on the streets that warn pedestrians when a car is approaching. I used simple storyboarding to prototype the concept, showing how it would work to help the pedestrians.

#### 2. The interactive billboard

I got this idea when observing at Times Square. Many tourists get their attention attracted by the countless billboards surrounding them, and not paying attention to their surrounding roads. If we can make use of these displays and show corresponding safety tips based on real-time road conditions, it can be both an informative and interesting way to help tourists navigate the streets safely.

![Storyboard]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Storyboard2.jpeg' | relative_url }})

#### 3. The wisdom of the crowd

People who are not familiar with NYC roads tend to follow others and imitate what locals do, but such reference may not be present all the time. Personally, I've encountered several occasions where a seemingly safe street can have surprising hidden dangers, or vice versa. Thus, I imagined an interactive display that uses augmented reality, to simulate a crowd, representing the average behavior of pedestrians under similar situations, generated from previously collected data.

![Storyboard]({{ '/assets/img/W10/Storyboard3.jpeg' | relative_url }})

While the task description instructed us to pick a final direction from the concepts, I feel like my final direction will be somewhat a combination of all of those above, since I feel like they are tackling different aspects of the problem, and I do feel like that the solutions require similar mediums and equipments.

### Conclusion

This week's workload is much higher for me compared to the previous phases. I was basically running out of time when I completed the research stage, therefore I feel like I could do a better evaluation of research results, and spend more time ideating and developing prototypes. I guess I will continue to make iterations and additions to the current concepts in the coming week.
