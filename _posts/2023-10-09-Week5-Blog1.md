*The last 2 days of operation of the KiHa 85 on the Nanki Limited Express service*

### The Story

I traveled from Nagoya to Kii-Katsuura at the end of June, to witness the retirement and bid farewell to the iconic キハ８５(KiHa 85) trains. These tickets are for the last 2 days of its revenue operation.

*Luxurious interior*

This type of limited express, diesel-powered train is notable for its extra-tall side windows, and a gorgeous panorama see-through driver's cab for the passengers to enjoy the front view. It was born in 1989, against the backdrop of two major social events:

1. The peak of Japan's bubble economy. Both producers and customers were eager to spend money and enjoy exotic experiences.
2. The dissolution and privatization of the Japan National Rail, which was in huge deficit. The newly created JR Groups that inherited the railways needed to find ways to compete with private operators, and attract riders to stay afloat.

As a result, this train was created with luxury inside and out and has served as an icon for high-performance tourism trains in Japan ever since. However, 30 years later, the bubble has long gone followed by decades of stagnant economy, and the decrease in population and travel demand pushed for a rethink in design.

*Waving goodbye to the last departure*

The new train replacing the KiHa 85, called HC85, is more modern, cost-conscious, and environment-friendly. The large windows remained, but gone are the show-stopper panorama cab and sofa-like seats. What's more, a switch to a hybrid DEMU system should reduce energy and emissions.
