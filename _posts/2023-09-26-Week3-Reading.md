### Technology Affordances

* This paper introduces the concept of affordance--the properties and possible actions an object provides, as well as its alignment with user perceptions, as a way to analyze user interfaces and design a transparent user experience.
* Takeaway: I think chaining and nesting affordances for a complex system is a good practice. It breaks down not-directly-perceptible actions into several more intuitive components. Also, I think chained affordances can be enhanced by transitioning between Hidden Affordances and Perceptible Affordances. For example, in the door handle scenario, the handle can loosen when grabbed (thus naturally creates a downward motion), and can pop open slightly when rotated down, making the "pullable" affordance perceptible.
*  For me, I think the single-lever style shower faucet (the kind without pressure control, this seems to be a U.S. thing) to have a poor perception-affordance alignment. The single action of twisting bears 2 function: the on/off of water, and the temperature control. For a twisting lever, I have no expectation that the slightest rotation will go from no water to 100% pressure, and stay the same for the rest of the rotation. Worse still, the one in my apartment looks exactly the same as other standard lift-and-twist faucets, making it more confusing.
* Question: Can an object's use of material also carry affordances?



### A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design

* The author argued that future interaction designs should move towards conforming and making use of human's natural capabilities, like taking advantage of haptic sense and the multitude of hand gestures and manipulations, which the current digital screen medium lacks.
* Takeaway: The picture denoting a "tool" should have a part that "fits the problem" (output) and a part that "fits the person" (input) is such an concise and spot-on demonstration of a tool's role as a amplifier/translator/adaptor between human action and desired results. In this sense, a perfect, transparent tool should feel like "superpower", allowing people to interact with the world in the most instinctive way but generate much greater power.
* An example of making use of the hand's manipulative ability, XR headsets have been gradually shifting from traditional game-controller like input scheme to hand tracking gesture controls as the technology becomes mature. This makes the experience much more intuitve and less cumbersome.
* Question: Now more than a decade later, interaction design have definitely come a long way. However, the digital screens seem to be here to stay, even in the most intuitve forms of human-computer interaction experience we can think of. As we continue to move forward, will we continue to find ways to complement and build systems around screens, or will we have to depart from it someday, and if so what's next?
