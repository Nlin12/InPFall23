### Reflection

##### Breaking Free from Perfectionism and the "Sketching" Spirit

Last week's readings on sketching and doodling as a thinking tool and a way to convey ideas have been quite inspiring to me. I find that the "sketching philosophy" of accepting things to be rough, incomplete, and open to improvements can also be adapted to pther processes.

I have actually always enjoyed doing crafting and handiworks like this week's Endangered Aminal project. However, I almost always find my self falling into the pitfall of perfectionism, undoing and redoing the same process over and over again for a 1mm off in measurement, or slamming on the break before even starting a project because I don't have enough confidence.

For this week's project, I tried to force myself to care less. If there's minor imperfections, I ignored them and carried on. In the end, my creation have lots of misalignments, leaking glues, and countless dents on the surface. But hey! It's a tuna! If anything those imperfections made it more personal and reminded me of how I created it. And granted, if I were more obsessed with the small details, I most likely won't be able to finish the assignment on time.

The readings are a reminder to me that a creative expression is fundamentally different from a engineering project in that it does not require complete precision and correctness. Rather than having pixel-perfect nothings, getting your ideas out, start small and constantly iterating is the better way to improve.
