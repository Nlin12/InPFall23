### Material

Since there's a great number of endangered animals, and I do not have a specific preference, I decide to let the materials I have in hand narrow the options down for me.

The recycles that I collected are mainly cardboards, plastic bottles, and soda cans. Among those, I found one object to be particularly interesting:

A soda can from Trader Joe's. Unlike other cans that have the packaging printed on them, this one uses a plastic wrap, making it very easy to peel off, and you get a can with pure metallic finish.

This kind of texture is pretty unique among a sea of plastics and graphic designs, so I decided to center my design around it.

### Choosing the animal

So which aminal will be suitable for this raw metallic texture? Fishes comes to mind--they mostly have silver bodies. Browsing the Red List, I came across the **Southern Bluefin Tuna**.

Coincidentally, I visited Nachikatsuura during my trip to Japan this summer. This is the biggest fresh tuna fishing port in Japan, which is the world's largest tuna consumer country. The major species there is exactly bluefin tunas--of course not the endangered one. Bluefin tunas are consisted of Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Bluefins. Although the other two are not endangered per se, they are also seen as vulunerable due to commercial fishing. Thus, the fishing of bluefin tunas are highly regulated in major producer countries like Japan and Australia.

At there I saw hundreds of tuna are brought to shore, immediately auctioned and transported all across the country. The tunas' beautiful, glossy and metallic silver body left me a strong impression.

This is a great fit for my aluminum meterial. Southern Bluefin Tuna it is then!

### Sketching

I decided to make metal foils from the side of the cans to form the shape of the tuna. Four pairs of foils comprise the body, and triangle foils are used for the tail and fins. Finally, I was planning to stick black and yellow colored cardboards to mimic the colors on its back and fins (more on that later).



But there was a problem: I only got 7 of these cans. In the original design just the body will cost me 8. I need to be more efficient with material usage. Through iterations I quickly found rooms of improvements: the rearmost part of body is now made from cutoffs from the part in front of it, achieved by mactching the two parts' circumfrence. Similarly, the pair of pectoral fins and the tail use the remaining triangles from the head part.



#### The Making Process

##### Cutting

Cutting off the tops and bottoms and slicing the side open. It turned out that these foils are way stiffer than I imagined, which made the process more challenging.

The foils are then trimmed to 14*10cm rectangles.

##### Main Body

Turns out it's very difficult to hold the foils in place and operate the glue gun at the same time, so I used Scotch to help with the assembly.

##### Oops

It was not until the body was glued together that I realized I forgot to cut the opening for the mouth--Great, now I have to cut aluminum floating in the air. The cutting was a bit messy, but at least nothing worse happened.

##### Tail and Fins

The rest are relatively smooth sail, just sticking multiple triangles on.

##### Change of Design

At this point the structure is finished, and I was going to add colors to it using these cardboards (which, are actually the exact boxes for this cans).

But looking at the all-sliver tuna, I found its texture in the current state to be extremly sleek and simple, and adding cardboards onto it will only break the coherence. Therefore, I decided to just keep it this way.

Instead, since my tuna is still lying on its side, I used the two boxes to create a simple stand:

Although a impromptu creation, I think this stand is actually pretty cool, reminding viewers where the materials for this tuna come from.

### Reflection

* This project made me more mindful of the waste I produce, and it's cool that during the process, the scarcity of cans actually made me find ways to reduce material consumption of my creation :)

* I'm glad that I decided to change the design and kept a single consistent texture. Capturing the most prominent characteristic sometimes is a more powerful and creative expression than simply mimicing the real life.
