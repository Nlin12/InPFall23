### Paper Prototyping

* The author discussed how using interactive paper-based prototypes to gather initial user feedback and find usability issues in the early stages of product development can be a more efficient and situation-appropriate way, compared to polishing code-heavy digital prototypes.
* Takeaway 1: Get people involved. Don't work for too long without getting feedback. This not only includes testing with users and getting their opinions, but also making sure people from development and marketing are also involved during the prototyping and usability testing process. This ensures the design does not exceed technical limitations or deviates from market demands.
* Takeaway 2: Polished prototypes are not only time-consuming, but they also invite nit-picking and suppress creativity. They carry the "false affordance" of being a finished interface and a final product, thus misleading users to focus more on the minute design choices and not the fundamental structure.
* Her comment on why not use computer-based prototypes is spot on. When I was interning as interaction designer, our Figma-based prototype would always get feedback on element size/arrangement, despite having already stated that the layouts are only a representation. I think the similarity between a digital vector prototype and the actual product makes people lazy and comfortably assume that this will be the final look. In contrast, a rough, unfinished prototype forces the user to imagine what it will be like in their own way.
* Question: Even though I agree with the author on the benefits of rough paper prototypes. I still think there are some advantages that computer prototyping software offer (especially considering how much software have evolved since the author wrote this in 2001), such as collaboration & sharing, version management, and being less resource-heavy (having people dedicated to manipulating paper prototypes is really a luxury). Moreover, these zero-code modern solutions can even be faster to create and iterate prototypes than on paper. Therefore I wonder if there are some "best of both worlds" solutions, like using software dedicated to mimicking sketch-like low-fidelity prototypes like Balsimiq, or a Figma plug-in that can "mess up" your prototype to get those uneven-sized buttons, curved lines, and ad hoc layouts?
