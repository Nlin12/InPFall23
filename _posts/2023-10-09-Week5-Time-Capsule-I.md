### Background

We're asked to think about narrative, legacy, and branding when approaching this project. Therefore, I wanted to pick items that not only are unique and have some "show off" value to them (branding), but also can be somewhat related across the board that convey a meaningful message (legacy and narrative).

Having just traveled across the Pacific, packing all my belongings under the economy class baggage allowance, there's not much in my possession that is worthy to write about. The majority of things that are not necessities are what I brought back from Japan this July--since this was a solo, one backpack trip, everything I bought and took back was pretty compact.

This is a good place to start, because I have a passion for trains and everything related to them, as well as the culture and development of human settlements. And it's no surprise that they are related to each other. Railways, and other forms of mass transit, are products of the Industrial Revolution, the evolution of cities, and people's will to travel and connect.

This interest is the incentive for my trip. Japan is known as the country with one of the most advanced and diversified rail transport networks, operating with sublime efficiency and punctuality. But what truly sets it apart is the deeply rooted connection between society and the railways, as well as the strong atmosphere of railway culture, from enthusiasts to ordinary commuters alike.

My time there was not just riding trains and enjoying the scenery. I experienced for myself how the availability of transportation changes a place's socioeconomic status and connects with and assimilates other cultures. I saw how towns that went through significant social changes are pondering and reevaluating what role does railway plays in their society, and are actively finding ways to either preserve the railway or establish better alternatives for future generations.

Therefore, I want to build my project around the objects that are connected to the railway, but focus not so much on traveling or scenery, instead **bring attention to the change and development of transportation systems**, and in a bigger sense, the **change and development of human settlements and the cultures**. I'd like my time capsule to promote thinking about **our relationship with transportation**, and how we should evolve and adapt them to the social changes of the future.

### The Objects

#### 1. Train Tickets

![Train Tickets]({{ '/assets/img/W5/04.jpeg' | relative_url }})

Basic, simple train tickets. They mark where you are from, where you are going to, and the date and time of your journey. As with other "railway enthusiasts", I try my best to keep all my tickets. At most Japanese train stations, if you approach the station staff, they will kindly stamp on the ticket that says "void, for commemoration of the ride", so that you don't have to pop them back into the ticket gates.

Some tickets are more "ordinary" by the face, mainly carrying personal memories only known to the bearer, some are more "collectible" since they are for some rare trains or special occasions--for example the highlight of my trip was to ride and see the retirement of a rolling stock. I feel like they are already pretty detailed and convenient documentation of a travel experience, almost like a de facto time capsule by itself. They can be lying in the bottom of your drawer for years, yet just accidentally discovering them again brings you straight back to that day and time, into the atmosphere on that particular train.

#### 2. IC Cards

![IC Cards]({{ '/assets/img/W5/05.jpeg' | relative_url }})

Compared to magnetic tickets that are primarily used for long-haul intercity journeys, IC Cards are the dominating means of getting around and commuting in a city. I always try to get my hands on a local transportation card wherever I go, and many times it's completely unnecessary since most of them either support contactless payment or are interoperable within the country. However, having a local one in my pocket gives me a strange feeling of "blending in".

Granted, as a tourist you'll never experience the city the same as those who earn their paychecks and build their family here, but I nevertheless appreciate those little moments where you're able to "do it the local way". Whether it be sitting at a restaurant's counter eating Tonkatsu next to the salarymen, packed like sardines with hundreds of high school students on the 7:30 AM train, wandering aimlessly in the park, or, simply using the same IC Card to travel. These moments get you closer to the real
"core" and vibe of the city.

Whether it's the Suica in Tokyo or MetroCard in NYC, I feel like they are the most widely used name card of the city. You can find them in every citizen's wallet, it speaks the image and identity of that place. Seeing my nearly 20 IC Cards from around the world is like having excerpts of the city lives in your hand.

#### 3. Souvenirs

![Souvenirs]({{ '/assets/img/W5/06.jpeg' | relative_url }})

These are not technically railway or train-related souvenirs. Instead, they represent the culture of the places I visited by train.

Truthfully speaking, I have rarely seen railway enthusiasts who love railway "only". Most people don't have the heartlessness (and money) to say, "Okay I've taken the train and arrived here, now let's go back." The idea of traveling and exploring is almost always tied with enjoying the railway--I mean, that's what railways are supposedly for after all. It's sometimes hard to say whether it's the trains that draw you to the destination, or the experience waiting for you at the end of the line that makes you excited about the train journey.

At least for me, I'm often in the mindset of "it's the trains that brought me here, but it's the people and culture that made me linger". I think of the railway as an opportunity, I take whatever trains that are available or spark my interest, and let it take me to where it's going. Nachi-katsuura, Toyama, Takayama--these are not necessarily the top recommendations that pop up when you search for travel destinations, and I could've easily looked past them. However, the railway gives me the opportunity to jump out of the ordinary circle and uncover the beauty at the end of the line.

#### Relationship between the items

I see these 3 categories of items not as separate things in the capsule, instead they can be a linked "set" that describes the process of a journey, or different representations of an experience with the railway. Therefore I might not present them in a one-by-one manner, rather to group them for a complete narrative.

This is also why I did not strictly stick to the 3-5 "items" rule, and instead prepared 3 categories of similar things. I do not want to focus on **a particular** ticket and what exactly happened on that trip, that's not the point. What I'm hoping is using multiple of those things to build a comprehensive image of the current state of railway and the society.

(This is also related to how I envisioned the form of my time capsule in Part II, more on that later.)

### The Medium

My first instinct is short-form social media platforms like X/Twitter. This is my go-to platform for sharing about my trip on the go, as well as many other enthusiasts in the community.

However, considering that this presentation is less about instant sharing and more about detailed introductions and documentation, I turned my eyes toward **traditional blog posts**.

This idea stems from my observations of such forms of documentation in the community. If you do a little digging on the Internet, you'll find loads of niche blogs or websites covering every aspect of railways and trains possible. These sites often are maintained by only one or a few people, and are operated on a passion-driven, not-for-profit basis. They might have absolutely ancient UI, but the sheer amount of detailed information they offer is astonishing. For me, I regard the authors of the blogs as pillars of the community, as well as curators of invaluable pieces of history.

*[クマ旅ｃｈ全駅ノート制覇企画](http://meiressha.jpn.org/note/note.html), they aim to leave a note on every station with a station note.*

*[どこでも発車メロディー](https://hassyaberu.com/), an archive of departure melodies used at different stations.*

Therefore, I decided to pay tribute to their contribution by using a similar form to present my time capsule items. (And the good thing is I already have a working blog to use right here!)

### The Blogs

I made 3 example blogs that introduce some sets of my railway-related items. I emphasized the social changes and developments that made the railway and the city the way it is now, hoping to promote thinking on the co-development relationship between people and transportation.

### Conclusion & Reflects

During the process of this assignment, I tried to focus on creating consistent branding and being relatable to the audience. The results are still undoubtedly personal and related to a specific interest, but I hope that by connecting the narrative to a "bigger picture", the message I try to convey can stay more relevant across time and culture.

### Envisions for Part II & III

The plan is not final yet, but through the ideation process of this week's work, I got an idea of the form of my time capsule, also inspired by things related to railway, that kind of reimagines the meaning of "burying" and "uncovering" a time capsule, one that can invite contribution and sharing from others.

I'm looking forward to updating and finalizing this idea in the coming week.
