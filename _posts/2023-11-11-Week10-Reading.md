### Designing for Interaction I

* The author discussed the development of interaction design, ways to look at interaction design, as well as the principles and approaches employed by interaction design.
* Takeaway: Design solutions should uniquely address the issues of a particular problem at a particular point in time. Don't be obsessed with being compatible with a scale too large, or worrying too much about being future-proof.
* The part of being technology agnostic during the interaction design process is a good principle. In real life we can see many designs carried out in the opposite direction due to feeling the need to showcase some new eye-catching technology. In the end, it either creates needs that don't exist or makes things unnecessarily complex.
* Question: Why does Apple do very little user testing and research compared to Microsoft? Is it still true today?

### What do Prototypes Prototype?

* The authors demonstrated problems with the practice of creating all-encompassing prototypes in the early stages and classifying prototypes based on their fidelity and method. Instead. the author advocates referring prototypes based on their intended purpose: role, look and feel,  implementation, and integration, and developing different focused prototypes separately.
* Takeaway: The example of using pizza boxes and storyboards as prototypes shows how it's not the fidelity or forms that matter, it's being clear about your intention and serving that intention exclusively with the prototype that's important.
* The explanation of why the Apple commercial and the Integrated Communicator prototype were more high-budget and polished answered my question from a couple of weeks ago. The ability to comprehend rough, low-fidelity prototypes/sketches/demos is an ability that is held by professionals in the field. When you're facing the general public or stakeholders, it's still worthwhile to increase the fidelity to ensure correct perception.
* Question: I found the classification and the ways to look at prototypes that this article introduces to be pretty valid and useful, but why years later, we are still seeing "low/high fidelity", "paper prototypes" and so on being used as the major way to classify prototypes?

### Universal Methods of Design

* I focused on Fly-on-the-Wall Observation and Contextual Inquiry (as well as related methods like Observation and AEIOU) since they are the methods that I was trying to carry out.
* Takeaway: The book suggested developing criteria to categorize observations for Fly-on-the-Wall observations, and in contextual inquiry, to learn to expand the limit beyond own personal focus, and follow the participant's experience. Also, the AEIOU framework can be useful for designing observations.
* The book helped me verify and finalize my method choice, and inspired me to diversify and classify my location selections for the fly-on-the-wall observation.
