### The Story

The Kurobe Alpine Route is a good example of repurposing previous industrial and infrastructure constructions into tourist attractions in an effort to rejuvenate the region. 

The Kurobe Dam was built in 1963, which aimed to resolve the energy shortage as a result of Japan's post-war economic boom. And routes were built for transporting materials for the construction of the dam--more than 100 people working on the dangerous project. To reach the dam high in the mountains, the route consists of a series of unique forms of transportation, including trains, cable cars, trolly buses, and boats. When the construction was finished, the dam was put into use until this day, but the routes lost their purpose.

*The Kurobe Dam and the Tateyama Mountain Range*

Therefore in 1971, the Alpine Route was born, retrofitting the existing route for passenger sightseeing service. It takes travelers all the way across the great Tateyama Mountain Range. Apart from hopping between different forms of transportation, they also get to enjoy views throughout the mountain range. The surrounding peaks also attract mountain climbers from around the world.

*The raw, industrial-style cable car and trolly bus tunnels*

In Japan and other countries alike, the regions that suffered from the most population loss and urban decay are mostly those specialized industrial areas that have since lost their pillar industry. For example, in Hokkaido, the shutdowns of coal mines in the 20th century have led to the disappearance of cities and the abandonment of more than half of its railway lines. I think the redevelopment of the Kurobe Alpine Route is an inspiration for similar places that are finding their way out through a structural change in the industry.
