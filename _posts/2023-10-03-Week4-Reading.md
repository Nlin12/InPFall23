### Metaphors & Imaginaries

* This paper discussed about using materialization methods (such as metaphor and visualization) as a way to better learn about how people understand a subject, and the human process of understanding itself.
* Takeaway: It's a human nature to simplify things, and it's necessary for our cognitive system to function effectively, especially when faced with unfamiliar, abstract concepts or complex systems. However, it's also important to remember that all simplifications might, to different extent, misrepresent/partially omit/distort the original subject. To mitigate this problem, it's benificial to switch up and remix the viewpoints (i.e. the metaphor or visualization used) through communicating and exchanging ideas with others.
*  Regarding using metaphors to facilitate the understanding of a system or concept, I find that new things are generally very dependent on metaphors, often establishing a direct connection and similarity to a matured object/concept. But as public recognition and acceptance grows, they will become less attached to metaphors. Examples include the shift from skeuromorphism (directly replication real-world objects) to flat/neumorphism (only inheriting some key properties) in digital UI design, and the design of EVs from trying to look like a "normal" gasoline car (e.g. the earliest model Tesla Model S has a fake black front grill) to developing its own new style (looking more like a computer mouse because of aerodynamics and the placement of batteries).
* Question: Is the creation of metaphors more often a trickle-down process (designers intentionally construct the metaphor and convey it to the user) or a bottom-up process (the users develop metaphors based on their understanding and expectation, which will then affect how following products are developed)?



### Nothing About Us Without Us

* This article discussed the systematic bias and injustice in the "processional design" field and design process (who gets a say in what is prioritized, who gets involved, who the target users are and what are their needs, who takes the credit etc.), and promotes design justice as a guiding philisophy to bring community participation, accountability and control into design process.

* Takeaway: Pretending to be another kind of person is NOT a good idea. Nor is exploiting others' ideas, doing the work for them, taking the credit and capitalizing the work, and repeating the loop. Designers should be offering their knowledge to communities while venturing to explore new ones, instead of monopolizing the skills and power, parachuting self-perceived solutions.

  There's a Chinese saying: 授人以鱼不如授人以渔--Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

* Not exactly from the design field, but for examples of the "bigger players", the famous and influential creators take inspiration from grass-roots and end up taking most of the credit, I think of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight/Wimoweh", which is heavily hased on "Mbube" by the South African songwriter Solomon Linda. The song first became a No. 1 single, then was used in Disney's The Lion King, but Solomon was not properly acknowledged until the 21st century, long after he died. More recently is the viral Internet hit of "The Wellerman" sea shanty. Even though the cover song became a worldwide phenomenon, the folk song's original creators, the sailors and their culture, received hugely disproportioned recognition.

* Question: The author talked about granting more accountability and ownership to the community that helped develop the design. He also acknowledges that for this to happen we need changes in policies. However, this again will be a situation where people in disadvantaged positions of the power matrix trying to lobby support form the establishment. This seems like an impossible cycle without much, much bigger social changes happening. So realistically speaking, is there any ways to start small and make gradual progresses?
