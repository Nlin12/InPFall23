### The Promise of Empathy: Design, Disability, and Knowing the â€œOther

* The authors showed how certain approaches to empathy can introduce negative effects to designing for users with disabilities, and proposed commitments to improve and reimagine the process.
* Takeaway: It's arrogant to assume that you can understand exactly what it's like to be someone you're not simply by mimicking them for a little time. Instead of trying to assimilate, try to accept a complementary relationship and design with your users.
* The treating disabled users as a spectacle part is pretty relatable and is a mindset that can be seen frequently. It's like saying "Now I have properly taken accessibility into account, you cannot criticize me for that, and I can show stakeholders how noble and professional I am" (you can probably also replace "accessibility" with something like "environment" or "social justice").
* Question: How can we improve the evaluation criteria for design works (both in work and school) to promote participation instead of "design savior" practices?

### Cultural Probes

* The authors introduced how they used "cultural probes" as a more engaging, open, and participatory user study method.
* Takeaway: I feel like a lot of the material and format decisions for the probe that the authors discussed are kind related to affordances, like why postcards convey a more attractive, informal, and friendly tone than questionnaires, and how they emphasize the individuality of the maps through variation of textures, and repackaged the disposable camera to make it feel less commercial.
* I like the opening of this paper. The fear of annoying your subject and making them feel bored is so relatable. I think fixed, unengaging and unattractive study methods does not only negatively affects how the subjects performs, but also will take a toll on the researcher themselves. I previously conducted a traditional simulation experiment for an interface with about 60 subjects, each subject takes about 1 hour to finish their experiment. Toward the end, I lost all interest in the experiment and the user and just wanted to act like a robot and get through this grueling repetition as soon as possible.
* Question: Are there ways to scientifically and structurally analyze and present the results from these less controlled research methods?

### Universal Methods of Design

* The book seems like an encyclopedia of various design research methods from different areas and stages of the design process.
* Takeaway: I kind of like the small grey box for each method that shows where the method falls on the spectrum. It can be useful to quickly grasp the nuance between methods, and to search for a suitable one based on the current situation.
* I find that while there sure are methods that are purposefully developed in a scientific and detailed way, there are also some methods that although I have not heard of before, upon reading them I felt "yeah that makes sense, I have done similar things in the past, both in and out of a design process". And I believe they are also developed this way, stemming from an intuitive approach or "hacks" to quickly gain knowledge and solve problems that are proven to be effective, and are then summarized into formal methods.
* Question: Do we really need *this* many methods? Is it really that every method has at least a particular, albeit small niche, where they are the single unrivaled best choice? Or are a small set of methods enough to mostly replace the rest and cover our design needs?
