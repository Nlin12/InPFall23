### Recap

Last week, we started out the UX Design Research Project, developed a mess map, and identified possible areas of interest and themes. My process last led me to the topic of "jaywalking", which is not something I expected, but I do find it an interesting phenomenon.

### Introduction

This week, we are supposed to continue to explore the topic and identify the research question. Besides, we would also create a stakeholder mapping.

I decided to stick with the phenomenon of jaywalking, and behind it, the bigger topic of how pedestrian navigates the urban environment. I think it can be fun to explore an often overlooked topic that also aligns with my interest in urban environments and cultures, despite not being an expected or familiar topic to me.

### Scope & Audience

I started by tackling the biggest problem of my project in its current state: the overly broad spectrum of focus and the lack of a specific target. I realized this problem during last week's class when we were discussing our work in pairs. We started to discuss who are the possible stakeholders for my project, and I said "pedestrians, drivers", along with some others. Although undoubtedly true, the first 2 categories are basically already covering all of NYC's population.

It's clear that in order to develop a specific and feasible research question, and to map out the stakeholders, I need to zoom in on my scope. Firstly, I decided to approach mainly from the pedestrian side and not the car drivers, mainly because I don't have personal experience with driving in NYC so I don't have much to relate to and feel engaged. In addition, the rule obeying level (as well as the law enforcement) is significantly higher in vehicle traffic.

But setting all pedestrians as the target audience is still too broad. People have different needs and priorities. While some can navigate the NYC streets effortlessly, some might feel perplexed or in danger at the same time. Out of all the pedestrians, I think it's safe to say that people with mobility limitations are among the people most vulnerable to safety and efficiency issues walking on the streets. However, I feel like this is not a social phenomenon specific to NYC, and is not the initial reason why the topic of jaywalking came up during the mess mapping process. Therefore, although accessibility is definitely a meaningful research topic, I once again turned back to what resonates with me and is the most heartfelt to me: the feeling of confusion and pressure about the different cultural norms as a newcomer or tourist.

### Literature Research & Research Question

Starting with the new problem scope and target, I started a new mess map to find specific problems/phenomena related to the topic and places for improvement. During this process, I conducted literature research into topics of pedestrian behavior and their social factors.

In terms of pedestrians' red light crossing behavior, there are plenty of studies using observational methods and mathematic models to construct the factors that are related to or can predict the action of running the red light. Apart from system factors like cycle length, waiting time (Raoniar & Mautya, 2022) and number of lines (Zhu et al., 2021), personal factors like age, gender (Zhu et al., 2020), sensation-seeking tendency (Rosenbloom & Tova, 2006), there's also significant influence of various **social factors**. This includes both situational social factors like how many people are waiting at the red light (Rosenbloom, 2008) (Raoniar & Mautya, 2022) and the presence of other violators and companions (Zhu et al., 2021), there's also more static factors that stemmed from cultural differences between societies. For example, Pelé et al. (2017) discovered that compared to French people, Japanese are not only more likely to follow the red light, but also they are paying more attention to what others are doing and adjust accordingly. Using computer vision and pose estimation, it is even possible to predict the intention to cross at red light based on their behavior at the intersection (Zhang et al., 2021).

In terms of the physical experience, I did some further research on the often-called "beg buttons" found on a portion of NYC road crossings. Originally intended to make the vehicle traffic flow more smoothly without being interrupted by unnecessary red lights when there are no pedestrians, it has been mostly phased out in NYC, due to the high pedestrian density in the city and the switch to a computer-based traffic cycle control system (PIX11, 2023) (Spectrum News, 2018), and are currently being converted into audio feedback systems for the visual impaired people (NYC DOT, n.d.).

Intersections controlled by stop signs instead of traffic lights make up another major part of urban roads in NYC and beyond. Although they do not operate exactly the same, it is reasonable to assume similar factors affect pedestrians' behavior at those intersections. This is because although the law requires vehicles to stop completely all the time, this is far from true in reality (Trinkaus, 1997), and stop-sign violations account for a significant portion of traffic accidents (Retting et al., 2003) and fatal crashes (Campbell et al., 2004).

Starting from the point of cultural differences, I came up with more related scenarios where things are done differently, from walking on the streets to unspoken etiquette in various public places. This made me unsure about the primary focus of my project again: focusing not just on road crossing, but also on the entire experience of navigating the city can be meaningful and fun, but I do feel like it will be a major shift from the previous direction and would again be too broad to focus. Therefore, I decided to leave them out at least for now.

After the narrowing down and literature research stages described above, I developed an initial version of my research question:

**Research Question:** How to reduce the efforts of newcomers and visitors to navigate NYC on foot safely and efficiently?

### Stakeholder Map

The next step is to map out the stakeholders for my project. Thanks to pinning down to a more specific problem and demographic, the previous problem of potential stakeholders including literally everyone is greatly mitigated.

From the stakeholder map, however, I do feel like the project in its current state is too full of stakeholders who are powerful but are hard to approach (I know solution and feasibility should not be a consideration now, but it's just too natural not to think this was when you're looking at the graph). I don't know if it will be a problem down the road, therefore I will keep a closer eye on this aspect of my project.

### Future Plans & Research Methods

In terms of research methods, I think a fly-on-the-wall observation is probably one of the best matches for studying pedestrian behavior, and it is in fact how many studies I found collected their data. In addition, I think a survey will be effective to directly collect what people feel different or confusing about navigating NYC streets. I would also consider trying out some methods introduced in reading materials, such as contextual inquiry (possibly walking with a person on the street, chatting while observing their behavior) and cultural probes for more open-ended, true-to-life experiences.
