### Lab, Field, Showroom Chapter 1

* The author discussed "constructive design research" and using it as a way to integrate design and research.
* Takeaway: Theories are not explicitly written, rather they are a result of prominent writings beginning to be widely accepted and recognized as such; Developing a new word for a concept can be a way to draw boundaries with existing terms and fields, enabling a freer discussion.
* I feel like letting researchers actually carry out their concept is not only beneficial for finding problems, but also it can make researchers more motivated and mindful of details. Many research projects were never intended to have "real-life applications" of any sort, under those circumstances, I think it can feel detached from the user and stakeholders in your process.
* Question: Although designers and the design field are definitely getting increasingly diversified, will the products we design also continue the path of catering to smaller and smaller segmented groups? Or will we lean toward concepts like universal design?

### Design Research, Chapter 2

* This article gave a rundown of many qualitative research methods (many of which I had learned but never "truly" used), especially the Contextual Inquiry (ethnography study) method, which is basically a combination of interviewing w/ context and fly-on-the-wall observation, following a master-apprentice model.
* Takeaway: There are a lot of considerations that go into semi-structured interviews. Some of which that I found interesting/valuable include: preparing questions by types: goal-oriented, system-oriented, attitude-oriented, etc.; a combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions to keep the conversation open but also maintaining control of the interview; encourage storytelling; avoid leading questions.
* I just feel like I always "knew" how a good design research design should be, but every time I would cheap out and opt for the easier one. "Proper" qualitative and quantitative methods like ethnographic study and 2-phase experiments seem to be too much of a hassle for school, and too expensive for companies, thus I rarely see them being put to actual use.
* Question: How to address the above issue?

### Research in Art and Design

* Frayling discussed in this paper how researchers, artists, and designers are often perceived by both the public and those people themselves as polar different figures that have completely different workflows. However, many practices that artists and designers do in their creative process are in fact research. Frayling divided research in the art and design field into 3 categories: research into/ research through/research for art and design.
* Takeaway: Doing science/design is much more like doing the other than we thought. And research has been and will continue to be one of the most important aspects of creative process and art and design education.
* I think it's still true that "art and design have been taught separately from the mainstream" (or rather most mainstream subjects have been taught without art and design). For engineering students, it's expected that you don't know about art and design (some even take it as an identity); and for art students, it is acceptable that they don't know much about technology tools. However, in today's world, it is increasingly important to have combined knowledge for many creative professions.
* Question: How do we further incorporate the third type, "research for art and design" into education? (From my understanding, this seems like some form of purely process-focused assessment of academic performance).
